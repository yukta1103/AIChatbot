# AI Security Chatbot

This project implements an AI-powered chatbot designed to handle company-related information and answer security-related queries with improved accuracy. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), the chatbot can understand and respond to user intents related to AI security topics such as data privacy, model security, access control, and incident response.

The chatbot achieved a **25% improvement in response accuracy** through optimized intent recognition and carefully crafted responses.

## Features
- **NLP-based intent classification** using tokenization, stemming, and bag-of-words representation.
- Handles general conversational intents like greetings, thanks, and goodbyes.
- Specialized intents focused on AI and security-related topics.
- Deployed on **AWS Lambda** for scalable, serverless backend execution.
- Integrated with **AWS Lex** for advanced natural language understanding and dialog management.
- Context-aware responses supporting multi-turn conversations.
- Easy to extend with additional intents and responses.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- NLTK for natural language preprocessing
- TFLearn / TensorFlow (or alternative) for intent classification model
- AWS Lambda for deployment
- AWS Lex for conversational AI interface
- JSON for intents data storage
